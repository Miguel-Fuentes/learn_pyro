# learn_pyro
The goal of this project is to learn to use Pyro for probabilistic programming. Nothing crazy, just copy the examples from the docs at first and make some tweaks to understand what is going on.

Note that I started this project as a way to participate in the DK30 challenge, for more information on this see here: https://day9.tv/dk30
