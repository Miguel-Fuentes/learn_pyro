    "## The Goal: Scaling SVI to Large Datasets\n",
    "For a model with N observations, running the model and guide and constructing the ELBO involves evaluating log pdf’s whose complexity scales badly with N. This is a problem if we want to scale to large datasets. Luckily, the ELBO objective naturally supports subsampling provided that our model/guide have some conditional independence structure that we can take advantage of. For example, in the case that the observations are conditionally independent given the latents, the log likelihood term in the ELBO can be approximated with the following:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N}logp(x_i|z) = \\frac{N}{M}\\sum_{i\\in I_M}logp(x_i|z)$$  \n",

    "So far so good. Pyro can now leverage the conditional independency of the observations given the latent random variable. But how does this actually work? Basically pyro.plate is implemented using a context manager. At every execution of the body of the for loop we enter a new (conditional) independence context which is then exited at the end of the for loop body. Let’s be very explicit about this:\n",
    "\n",
    " - because each observed pyro.sample statement occurs within a different execution of the body of the for loop, Pyro marks each observation as independent\n",
    "\n",
    " - this independence is properly a conditional independence given latent_fairness because latent_fairness is sampled outside of the context of data_loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will not achieve the desired behavior, since list() will enter and exit the data_loop context completely before a single pyro.sample statement is called. Similarly, the user needs to take care not to leak mutable computations across the boundary of the context manager, as this may lead to subtle bugs. For example, pyro.plate is not appropriate for temporal models where each iteration of a loop depends on the previous iteration; in this case a range or pyro.markov should be used instead.\n",

Just like for sequential plate, the user is responsible for selecting the correct datapoints using the indices provided by plate.\n",

To avoid this the user can take control of subsampling by making use of the subsample argument to plate. See the docs for details.\n",

To see how this looks in detail, see the VAE tutorial.\n",

To make things simple let’s keep the discussion somewhat abstract and avoid writing a complete model and guide.\n",

In addition, given $\\beta$ the latent random variables $\\{z_i\\}$ are independent. On the guide side, given the variational parameters $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$ and $\\beta$ the latent random variables $\\{z_i\\}$ are independent. To mark these conditional independencies in Pyro and do subsampling we need to make use of plate in both the model and the guide.
