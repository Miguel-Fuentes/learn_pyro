## Purpose
The point of this project is just for me learn the probabilistic programming language Pyro and as much of the underlying theory as possible. I know nothing about epidemiology so the point isn't to create an accurate model for the trnasmission of the coronavirus. As I started copying over the examples from the Pyto ducumentation and running the code I realized that I will learn better if I try to apply all of the lessons to my own proble. I thought about what problem to model for a while and I eventually decided to model different aspects of coronavirus transmission because since I am currently in lockdown because of COVID-19 it has been on my mind
